My project is based around an IP Network Scanner.

When your iPad / Device is connected to a wireless network, 
It will scan the network for active devices currently connected to the same network.

It will report back details for each connected device - such as 
-IP Addresses 
-MAC Address
-Hardware Information - PC / MAC / Mobile Device
-Operating system Type - Windows / Mac / Linux
-Operating system Version - XP / Win 7 / Win 8 / Mac OS X / IOS 
- Machine Name
- Open ports

Also report on General Network statistics.
- Available Bandwidth
- Percentage Utilisation

I want to include a telnet / ssh client to allow the user select a device typically a CISCO router or switch and be able to connect remotely to view / check configurations

I also would like to include standard diagnostics
-Ping
-Tracert
-pathping
I will log the statistics to a database for later viewing, perhaps using a webservice to communicate them back to a dabatase.
This will allow me to incorporate the Core Data and Core WLan frameworks.
Time permitting I would also like to include a packet sniffer to capture data on the network to assist troubleshooting of issues on Layer 1 - 4 of the OSI Model
