Assignment 3 Part 1


//Comments
Added a label to display an error message if user trys a divide by zero or square root of a negative number or inverse of 0.

The calcDisplayErrorMessage label on the storyboard is updated via a delegate mechanism.

If an error occurs I set the hidden property of the calcDisplay TextField to false, and display the error message in calcDisplayErrorMessage Label.

As per Extra Marks 1 I have also included an UIAlertView to display the same error to the user.
