Assignment 2


//Comments
Implemented Buttons and UIStepper increase / decrease and Left / Right Swipe Gesture Controls to control the poloygon selection.

Decrease / Increase buttons enable and disable when min / max polygon sides are reached.

Implemented 2 View Controllers via a tab view control
Polygon tab has main functionality 
Setings tab allows user to polygon change color
Using NSUserDefaults to save color choice to phone

Notes on Polygon Tab design:
Normally I wouldn't put UIButtons (increase an decrease number of sides) and UIStepper contol and SwipeGesture controls as the UI is starting to look overly complicated. I have included them "For Show".
